# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Tyler
**Date:** 2025-12-03

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Creating a practical development system/framework that implements the "What You See Is What It Does" pattern for legible software

**Goals:**
- Understand what components/tools you need to create
- Figure out where to start and what to build first
- Create a roadmap from "interested in the idea" to "actively writing software this way"
- Identify the minimal viable framework to start using this pattern

### Context Guidance

_This session is inspired by the whitepaper "What You See Is What It Does: A Structural Pattern For Legible Software" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14511). The core concepts include:_

_- **Concepts**: Fully independent services operating autonomously_
_- **Synchronizations**: Event-based rules that coordinate between concepts_
_- **Goals**: Making software transparent, incremental, and maintaining integrity_
_- **Key Innovation**: Code structure directly corresponds to system behavior, making it legible for both humans and LLMs_

### Session Setup

_Tyler is exploring how to create a practical framework for writing software using the WYSIWYG pattern. This is his first time approaching this kind of framework creation opportunity. The focus is on identifying what needs to be built and creating a concrete path forward from concept to implementation._

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Creating a practical development system/framework with focus on understanding what to build, where to start, and identifying minimal viable framework

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **First Principles Thinking** (Creative) - Strip away assumptions about what a framework needs to be and rebuild from fundamental truths about the WYSIWYG pattern. Expected outcome: Clear understanding of actual requirements vs assumed requirements.

2. **Morphological Analysis** (Deep) - Systematically explore all possible components and their combinations to comprehensively map the solution space. Expected outcome: Complete landscape of what could be built.

3. **Resource Constraints** (Structured) - Impose extreme limitations to identify what must be built first and create a prioritized roadmap. Expected outcome: Clear starting point and minimal viable framework definition.

**AI Rationale:** This three-phase sequence moves from abstract→concrete and theory→practice, matching Tyler's journey from "inspired by whitepaper" to "ready to implement." It addresses his key challenges: understanding fundamentals (Phase 1), identifying all components (Phase 2), and determining where to start (Phase 3).
